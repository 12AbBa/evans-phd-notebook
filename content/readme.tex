\itshape public shaming is a good study strategy, i swear
\end{quote}

This is a repository where I keep the \TeX\ source notes about math I'm studying
in connection to my PhD thesis. By definition, everything here is stuff I'm
learning for the first time. The content is therefore likely to be riddled with
errors, inaccuracies, and is generally in a really rough state.

\section*{Where can I get this compiled PDF?}
Use the URL \url{https://web.evanchen.cc/upload/evans-phd-notebook.pdf}.

\section*{Why did you post this?}
Mostly to force myself to actually do work by holding myself accountable. If I
don't commit anything here for a while, then it'll be obvious I've been slacking
off, and then everyone in the world can see:

There is one other benefit to me. I expect 90\% of people reading this repository
won't understand a single word of what's going on, and will just be like ``orz''.
Which is good public relations for me, because then I can keep pretending I'm
good at math, when really I have absolutely no fucking clue what I'm doing.

\section*{What field of math is this?}
Number theory, specifically automorphic forms and representations.

\section*{Who's your advisor?}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Zhang_(mathematician)}{Wei Zhang}.
Who by the way is the nicest advisor ever.

\section*{Can you give me a research project to work on?}
No.
