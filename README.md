# Evan's PhD Notebook

This is a repository where I keep the TeX source notes about math I'm studying
in connection to my PhD thesis. By definition, everything here is stuff I'm
learning for the first time. The content is therefore likely to be riddled with
errors, inaccuracies, and is generally in a really rough state. There are more
holes than Swiss cheese.

## What are the relevant files?

- `notes/` contains some scattered notes on things that I did in the first few years of study
- `thesis/` contains the thesis itself
- `slides/` contains slides from talks I gave about the thesis

Compiled PDF's will be uploaded starting around 2025 or so.
(I'm pausing the PDF uploading for the home stretch while I tidy things up.
Build them yourself if you really want to see them.)

## What field of math is this?

Number theory, specifically automorphic forms and representations.

## Who's your advisor?

[Wei Zhang][wei]. Who by the way is the nicest advisor ever.

[wei]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Zhang_(mathematician)

## Can you give me a research project to work on?

No.
