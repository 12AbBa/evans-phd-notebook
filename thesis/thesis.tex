\begin{abstract}
  As an analog to the Jacquet-Rallis fundamental lemma that appears in the
  relative trace formula approach to the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures,
  the arithmetic fundamental lemma was proposed by W.\ Zhang and used in an approach
  to the arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures.
  Both the Jacquet-Rallis fundamental lemma and arithmetic fundamental lemma
  were recently generalized to conjectural statements that hold
  for an arbitrary function in the associated spherical Hecke algebras.
  This paper produces explicit formulas for the orbital integrals that appear
  in certain cases of the arithmetic fundamental lemma for the spherical Hecke algebra,
  thus verifying the conjecture in some particular cases.
