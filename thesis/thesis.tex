\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  As an analog to the Jacquet-Rallis fundamental lemma that appears in the
  relative trace formula approach to the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures,
  the arithmetic fundamental lemma was proposed by W.\ Zhang and used in an approach
  to the arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures.
  The Jacquet-Rallis fundamental lemma was recently generalized by S.\ Leslie
  to a statement holding for the full spherical Hecke algebra.
  In the same spirit, there is a recent conjectural generalization
  of the arithmetic fundamental lemma to the full spherical Hecke algebra.
  This paper formulates another analogous conjecture for the semi-Lie version
  of the arithmetic fundamental lemma proposed by Y.\ Liu.
  Then this paper produces explicit formulas for particular cases
  of the weighted orbital integrals in the two conjectures mentioned above.
