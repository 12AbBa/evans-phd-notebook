### Main tasks

1. [x] Fill out the gaps in the base change section
2. [x] Write up $\ell \le 2 \delta$ and related results.
3. [x] Work out the edge case $v(b) > 0$
4. [ ] Work out the edge case $v(b) = v(d) < 0$.
5. [ ] Write out the summation interchange in $S_3(F)$ case
6. [x] Write the relative fundamental lemma for group version
7. [x] Conjecture relative fundamental lemma for semi-Lie version
8. [ ] Write out the summation interchange in $S_2(F) \times V_2'$ case
9. [ ] Get a draft of the geometric side for semi-Lie when $n = 2$
10. [ ] Prove the large kernel conjecture
11. [ ] Document transfer factors.

## Things to do if we have time

- [ ] Maybe the part with $Y_1$ could be generalized to.
- [ ] Take the derivative of the known orbital integral
