## Wishlist of sub-tasks for Evan to work on this week (before Sept 13)

### Easy stuff

1. [x] Fix the things going over the edges
2. [x] Write an abstract
3. [x] Define an arch
4. [x] Generalize the Satake calculations to $n$ variables from $n = 3$
5. [ ] Maybe the part with $Y_1$ could be generalized to.
6. [ ] Take the derivative of the known orbital integral

### Harder stuff

7. [ ] Fill out some of the gaps in the base change section.
8. [ ] Make the total contribution of Cases 3+/3-/4+ fully explicit
9. [ ] Work out the edge cases that don't have $v(b) = v(d) = 0$.

### Fourier-Lie case

10. [ ] Work out what to express the answer in terms of
11. [ ] Repeat as much of the calculation as I can actually deal with
