## Wishlist of sub-tasks for Evan to work on this week (before Sept 13)

### Easy stuff

1. [ ] Fix the things going over the edges
2. [ ] Write an abstract
3. [ ] Define an arch
4. [ ] Generalize the Satake calculations to $n$ variables from $n = 3$
5. [ ] Take the derivative of the known orbital integral

### Harder stuff

6. [ ] Fill out some of the gaps in the base change section.
7. [ ] Make the total contribution of Cases 3+/3-/4+ fully explicit
8. [ ] Work out the edge cases that don't have $v(b) = v(d) = 0$.

### Fourier-Lie case

9. [ ] Work out what to express the answer in terms of
10. [ ] Repeat as much of the calculation as I can actually deal with
