## Wishlist of sub-tasks for Evan to work on this week (before Sept 13)

### Main tasks

1. [ ] Fill out the gaps in the base change section
2. [x] Work out the edge case $v(b) > 0$
3. [ ] Work out the edge case $v(b) = v(d) < 0$.
4. [ ] Write out the summation interchange in $S_3(F)$ case
5. [ ] Write out the summation interchange in $S_2(F) \times V_2'$ case
6. [ ] Get a draft of the geometric side for semi-Lie when $n = 2$
7. [ ] Prove the large kernel conjecture

## Things to do if we have time

- [ ] Maybe the part with $Y_1$ could be generalized to.
- [ ] Take the derivative of the known orbital integral
