\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\pdfbookmark[0]{Acknowledgments}{acknowledgments}

I thank my advisor Wei Zhang for suggesting this project
and for his infinite patience and kindness
throughout my entire time during graduate school at MIT.
Without the encouragement and support from Wei,
I would certainly never have completed my thesis or even passed my qualifying exams.

I also thank MIT itself for serving as my home for the last ten years,
and the math department for supporting me since I started graduate school.
I'd like to thank Bjorn Poonen and Barbara Peskin in particular
for some words of encouragement during my earlier years of PhD study,
and Theresa Cummings and Michele Gallarelli for their assistance throughout my studies.

I thank the organizers and attendees of the fall 2024
learning seminar on arithmetic inner product formula
for inviting me to speak about my work-in-progress, and their helpful comments on it
leading directly to improvements to this thesis.

I thank Mark Sellke for proofreading a draft of this thesis
and finding several corrections.

Finally, I thank Zhiwei Yun and Ben Howard for serving on my thesis committee,
as well as David Vogan and Nike Sun for serving on my qualifying exams committee.

This work was partially supported by NSF GRFP under grant numbers 1745302 and 2141064.
