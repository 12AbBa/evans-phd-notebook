and $E/F$ is an unramified quadratic field extension.

\subsection{History and motivation for the arithmetic fundamental lemma}
The primary motivation for this paper arises from
the study of conjectured variants of the arithmetic fundamental lemma
for spherical Hecke algebras proposed in \cite{ref:AFLspherical}.
This section briefly provides an overview of the historical context
that led to the formulation of these conjectures.
This history is also summarized in \Cref{fig:history}.
A more detailed account can be found in \cite{ref:survey}.

\subsubsection{The GGP conjectures, and the fundamental lemma of Jacquet-Rallis}
In modern arithmetic geometry, a common theme is that there are deep connections
between geometric data with the values of related $L$-functions.

This story begins with a result of
Waldspurger \cite{ref:waldspurger} which showed a formula
relating the nonvanishing of an automorphic period integral
to the central value of the same $L$-functions.
Later, a conjecture that generalizes Waldspurger's formula
was proposed by Gross-Prasad in \cite{ref:GP1,ref:GP2}.
This was further generalized to a series of conjectures
now known as the Gan-Gross-Prasad (GGP) conjectures,
which were proposed in 2012 in \cite{ref:GGP};
they generalize the Gross-Prasad conjecture to different classical groups.
Specifically, the GGP conjecture predict the nonvanishing of a period integral
based on the values of the $L$-function of a certain cuspidal automorphic representation.

In 2011, Jacquet-Rallis \cite{ref:JR} proposed an approach to the Gross-Prasad conjectures
for unitary groups via a relative trace formula (RTF).
The idea is to compare a RTF for the general linear group to one for a unitary group.
This approach relies on a so-called \emph{fundamental lemma},
which links values of certain orbital integrals
over two reductive groups over a non-Archimedean local field.

Let's be a bit more precise about what this fundamental lemma says.
Let $V_0$ denote a split $E/F$-Hermitian space of dimension $n$,
fix a unit vector $w_0$ in it,
and let $V_0^\flat$ be the orthogonal complement of the span of $w_0$.
Let $G'^\flat \coloneqq \GL_{n-1}(E)$, $G' \coloneqq \GL_n(E)$,
$G^\flat \coloneqq \U(V_0^\flat)(F)$ and $G \coloneqq \U(V_0)(F)$.
For certain
\[ \gamma \in G'^\flat \times G', \qquad g \in G^\flat \times G \]
the Jacquet-Rallis fundamental lemma proposes a relation between two orbital integrals.
Specifically, it supplies a relation between
\begin{itemize}
\item the orbital integral of $\gamma$ with respect to
  the indicator function $\mathbf{1}_{K'^\flat \times K'}$
  of the natural hyperspecial compact subgroup
  \[ K'^\flat \times K' \subset G'^\flat \times G' = \GL_{n-1}(E) \times \GL_n(E); \]
  and
\item the orbital integral of $g$ with respect to
  the indicator function $\mathbf{1}_{K^\flat \times K}$
  of the natural hyperspecial compact subgroup
  \[ K^\flat \times K \subset G^\flat \times G = \U(V_0^\flat)(F) \times \U(V_0)(F). \]
\end{itemize}
In other words, it states that
\begin{equation}
  \Orb(\gamma, \mathbf{1}_{K'^\flat \times K'}) = \omega(\gamma) \Orb(g, \mathbf{1}_{K^\flat \times K})
  \label{eq:old_FL}
\end{equation}
where $\omega(\gamma)$ is a suitable \emph{transfer factor}.
The fundamental lemma has since been proved completely;
a local proof was given by Beuzart-Plessis \cite{ref:BeuzartPlessis}
while a global proof was given for large characteristic by W.\ Zhang \cite{ref:Wei2021}.

\subsubsection{The arithmetic GGP conjectures, and the arithmetic fundamental lemma.}
At around the same time Waldspurger's formula was published,
Gross-Zagier \cite{ref:gross_zagier} proved a formula
relating the height of Heegner points
on certain modular curves to the derivative at $s=1$ of certain $L$-functions.
The Gross-Zagier formula was then generalized over several decades,
culminating in \cite{ref:GZshimura} where the formula is established
for Shimura curves over arbitrary totally real fields.

An arithmetic analogue of the original Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures,
which we henceforth refer to as \emph{arithmetic GGP} \cite{ref:GGP},
can then be formulated, generalizing Gross-Zagier's formula.
Here the modular curves in Gross-Zagier
are replaced with higher dimensional Shimura varieties.
Rather than the period integrals considered previously,
one instead takes intersection numbers of cycles on some Shimura varieties.
Specifically, if one considers the Shimura variety associated to a classical group,
the arithmetic GGP conjecture predicts a relation between intersection numbers
on this Simura variety with the central derivative of automorphic $L$-functions.

By analogy to the work Jacquet-Rallis \cite{ref:JR},
the arithmetic GGP conjectures should have a corresponding
\emph{arithmetic fundamental lemma} (henceforth AFL),
which was proposed by W.\ Zhang \cite{ref:AFL}.
The arithmetic fundamental lemma then relates the derivative
of the orbital integral with respect to the indicator function
$\mathbf{1}_{K'^\flat \times K'} \in \HH(G'^\flat \times G, K'^\flat \times K')$, that is
\[ \left. \pdv{}{s} \right\rvert_{s=0} \Orb(\gamma, \mathbf{1}_{K'^\flat \times K'}) \]
for $\gamma \in G'^\flat \times G'$,
to arithmetic intersection numbers on a certain Rapoport-Zink formal moduli space.
The AFL in \cite{ref:AFL} has since been proven over $p$-adic fields for any prime $p$ in
Mihatsch-Zhang \cite{ref:MZ2021}, W.\ Zhang \cite{ref:Wei2021}, Z.\ Zhang \cite{ref:Zhiyu}.

\subsubsection{Generalizations of FL and AFL to spherical Hecke algebras}
Recently it was shown by Leslie \cite{ref:leslie} that in fact
\eqref{eq:old_FL} holds in greater generality where the indicator function
$\mathbf{1}_{K^\flat \times K}$ can be replaced by any element
in the spherical Hecke algebra $\varphi \in \HH(G'^\flat \times G', K'^\flat \times K')$.
In that case, $\mathbf{1}_{K'^\flat \times K}$ needs to be replaced
by the corresponding element $\varphi'$ under a certain base change homomorphism
\[ \varphi \mapsto \varphi' \qquad
  \HH(G'^\flat \times G', K'^\flat \times K') \to \HH(G^\flat \times G, K^\flat \times K). \]
In that case, the identity \eqref{eq:old_FL} still hold as
\begin{equation}
  \Orb(g, \varphi) = \omega(\gamma) \Orb(\gamma, \varphi').
  \label{eq:eq:leslie_FL}
\end{equation}
To complete the analogy illustrated in \Cref{fig:history},
there should thus be a generalization of the AFL in which
$\mathbf{1}_{K'^\flat \times K}$ is replaced by any element of the Hecke algebra
$\HH(G'^\flat \times G, K'^\flat \times K)$.
This formula is proposed by \cite{ref:AFLspherical},
and is the primary focus of this paper; we discuss it in the next section.

\subsection{The inhomogeneous version of the arithmetic fundamental lemma for spherical Hecke algebras}
Retain the notation $G' \coloneqq \GL_n(E)$, and $G \coloneqq \U(V_0)(F)$,
with $K' \subset G'$ and $K \subset G$ the natural hyperspecial compact subgroups.
For concreteness, we focus on the inhomogeneous version
of the arithmetic fundamental lemma, which is \cite[Conjecture 6.2.1]{ref:AFLspherical},
which allows us to deal with just $G'$ instead of $G'^\flat \times G'$, etc.

Let $q$ denote the residue characteristic of $F$.
Also define the symmetric space
\[ S_n(F) \coloneqq \left\{ g \in \GL_n(E) \mid g \bar{g} = \id_n \right\}. \]
In this case, the orbital integrals in the inhomogeneous AFL
are stated more naturally in terms of $f'$ contained in a certain
$\HH(G',K')$-module which we will denote $\HH(S_n(F), K')$;
it is defined later in \Cref{sec:background}.

\begin{conjecture}
  [{\cite[Conjecture 6.2.1]{ref:AFLspherical}}]
  \label{conj:inhomog}
  Let $f \in \HH(G, K)$ be any element of the Hecke algebra,
  and let $f' \in \HH(S_n(F), K')$ be its image
  under a base change $\BC_{S_n}^{\eta^{n-1}}$ defined in \Cref{sec:satake}.
  Then for certain pairs $g \in G$\todo{in $G$, right? check with Wei}
  and $\gamma \in S_n(F)$, we have
  \begin{equation}
    \Int\left( (1,g), \mathbf{1}_{K'^\flat \otimes f} \right) \log q
    = -\omega(\gamma) \left. \pdv{}{s} \right\rvert_{s=0} \Orb(\gamma, f').
    \label{eq:inhomog}
  \end{equation}
\end{conjecture}

At present, the (inhomogeneous) AFL is the case where $f = \mathbf{1}_K$ and is thus proven.
The generalized conjecture is also proved in full for
$n = 2$ in \cite[Theorem 1.0.1]{ref:AFLspherical}
(in that reference, our $n$ denotes their $n+1$).
The part of the calculation involving orbital integral has two parts:
\begin{itemize}
  \ii The calculation makes $\BC_{S_{n}}^{\eta^{n-1}}$
  completely explicit in a natural basis for $n = 2$.
  The result is \cite[Lemma 7.1.1]{ref:AFLspherical}.

  \ii The calculation makes explicit the value of the orbital integral
  \[ \Orb(\gamma, f') \]
  for any $\gamma \in S_n(F)$ and $f' \in \HH(S_n(F), K')$,
  in terms of invariants of $\gamma$ and a decomposition of $f'$ in a natural basis.
  The result is \cite[Proposition 7.3.2]{ref:AFLspherical}.
\end{itemize}
Combining these two (hence obtaining the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:inhomog})
with a calculation of intersection numbers in \cite[Corollary 7.4.3]{ref:AFLspherical}
(which is the left-hand side of \eqref{eq:inhomog})
shows that \Cref{conj:inhomog} holds for $n = 2$,
cf.\ \cite[Theorem 7.5.1]{ref:AFLspherical}.

\subsection{Results}
The goal of this paper is to perform the analogous calculations
that correspond to \cite[Lemma 7.1.1 and Proposition 7.3.2]{ref:AFLspherical}
in two new situations:
\begin{itemize}
  \ii The case $n = 3$ as in \Cref{conj:inhomog},
  which involves the orbits of $\GL_2(F)$ on a certain symmetric space $S_3(F)$.

  \ii A parallel Fourier-Jacobi version where one instead takes the action
  of $\GL_2(F)$ on $S_2 \times F^2 \times F_2$.
\end{itemize}
The methods, which are local in nature,
are rather similar to those employed in \cite{ref:AFL},
which shows how to compute the orbital integral for $n = 3$ when $f = \mathbf{1}_{K'}$.
We state these results as follows.

\begin{theorem}
\end{theorem}
\todo{write summary theorem}

Besides providing evidence for \Cref{conj:inhomog},
these orbital integral formulas also establish some other results.
For example, the formula above
proves the $n = 3$ case of \cite[Conjecture 8.2.1]{ref:AFLspherical}
and an analogous version; we state this below.

\begin{theorem}
\end{theorem}
\todo{need to figure out why there are all these semisimple restrictions}

\subsection{Roadmap}
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
We provide some necessary background and notation in \Cref{sec:background}.
Then, in \Cref{sec:orbital0} we describe our results on the orbital integral,
and dedicate \Cref{sec:orbital1,sec:orbital2} to their proof.
And in \Cref{sec:satake} we provide the explicit base change formula.
